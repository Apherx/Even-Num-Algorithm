# Even-Num-Algorithm
Algorithm:
Step 1: Make a list called "Even numbers"
Step 2: let n = the first number from the left of the list
Step 3: Divide n by 2 
Step 4: If result == an integer (No fraction or decimal) add that number to the "Even numbers" list. move n to the next number then go to step 3
Step 5: if result â‰   an integer (fraction or decimal). move n to the next number then go to step 3
Step 6: Displays the "Even numbers" list when all numbers has been processed.

Output:
List = [5,4,3,6,7,7,1,1]
n = 5
5 divided by 2
= 2.5 or 5/2.
Moving to the next number...
n = 4
4 divided by 2
= 2
4 is added to the "Even numbers" list
Moving to the next number...
n = 3
3 divided by 2
= 1.5 or 3/2
Moving to the next number...
